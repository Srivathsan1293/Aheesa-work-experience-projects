Researched and created a presentation about UAT, or The Universal Approximation
Theorem. UAT is a pillar stone in Neural Networks which it both explains and is the
reason for the recent research. As part of the presentation I had to learn what neural
networks are, how they operate, what are their applications, how they are trained,
and also explain how different types of neural networks operate. During the research
for this presentation I was able to use knowledge learnt from previous challenges
giving me useful background information. Allowing me to explain clearly when
presenting to the team.
